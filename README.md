> A zoo for decorators

There are many great decorators out there that we use everyday.

However there are also few decorators that I found myself implementing over and over in different projects. The hope is to gather them here and use this codebase.

## Alpha Notice
This package is really new and there are edge cases that probably doesn't cover (yet).

## Installation

You can install the library using `pip`:

```bash
python -m pip install deczoo
```

## Features

The library implements few function decorators:

- `call_counter`: Counts how many times a function has been called
- `catch`: Wraps a function in a try-except block
- `check_args`: Checks that function arguments satisfy given rules
- `chime_on_end`: Notify with chime sound on function end
- `dump_result`: Saves function result in a pickle file
- `log`: Tracks function time taken, arguments and errors
- `retry`: Wraps a function with a retry block
- `timeout`: Adds a time limit to a function
